I watched him teach them how to think about any problem and how to be confident and successful in any class. I was literally crying. They really needed that time with him and we can't thank him enough.",

My dad scheduled a tutoring session at ████████ with Dr. Michalicek and I went thinking that it was going to be a waste of time, but that really helped me a lot! I told other students in my classes and we scheduled group study sessions with him before finals and it made a huge difference.",

OK, now imagine a teacher than shows you how easy it is up front so you never waste time telling yourself you can’t do it. That was really helpful and a big lesson I needed to learn.",

My goal was to work for ████████ as an electrical engineer and [The Bona Vias Foundation] told me exactly which schools would give me the best chance for hiring. I just declared at ████████ and when I asked my department head about it, he said the same thing and later introduced me to their recruiter!",

But when we talked to Dr. Michalicek, we worked backwards from degree requirements to take advantage of community college without paying for extra courses that my son wouldn’t need to graduate. That saved us a lot of money and my son won’t need to overload or take extra semesters. We would have paid good money for his help, but he didn’t charge us a dime!",

He showed me more ways to decide on a major than any school counselor ever did and I earned a BS in Physics because it’s a good foundation for engineering and I could specialize later when I get a Master’s degree. When I graduated, I really felt like I qualified for a much wider range of jobs. I work at ████████ now and they are paying for my MS in Renewable Energy at ████████ and I really feel like this was the best way I could have gone.",
